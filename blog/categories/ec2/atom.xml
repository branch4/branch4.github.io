<p>Today, I give some tips about setting the time on EC2 of AWS.<br/>
(AWS, is a cloud hosting service of Amazon)</p>

<p>If you set the time from UTC to your local time by following the instruction you usually get from googling,<br/>
the time of EC2 might be reverted to UTC after the server reboots, <br/>
not every time but sometimes&hellip;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<h3>The way which you can get by googling</h3>

<hr />

<p><code>cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Tokyo /etc/localtime</code></p>

<p>You usually could find the instruction like above.<br/>
The time setting will soon become your local time.  <br/>
It’s so easy! Done!</p>

<p>But by this way, the time might get back to UTC.<br/>
You need to be careful, because it would happen not every time you reboot the server, but sometimes.</p>

<p>For me, it was after almost a year of service release that the time was reverted to UTC. <br/>
That was so troublesome since cron and application see the time.</p>

<h3>Why the time gets back to UTC</h3>

<hr />

<p>The thing is&hellip; when glibc package gets updated,<br/>
/etc/localtime will be set to UTC by the script included in the glibc package.</p>

<p>In the case of Amazon Linux, cloud_init exec the security updates as the server starts.<br/>
The time setting will be initialized at that time.</p>

<p>So, when you reboot the EC2 server after its glibc package gets updated,<br/>
cloud_init update the package and /etc/localtime will be initialized.</p>

<p>This is why the time gets back to UTC.</p>

<h3>How to avoid the initialization of the time setting on EC2</h3>

<hr />

<p>There are two ways of dealing with the issue above.</p>

<p>1.Edit not &ldquo;/etc/localtime”, but “/etc/sysconfig/clock”</p>

<p><code>
ZONE="Asia/Tokyo"
UTC=False
</code>
to ZONE, you need to set your local identifier.<br/>
It’s the case for Tokyo, Japan.</p>

<p>2.Disable the security updates by editing cloud_init config “/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg"</p>

<p>It’s not recommended.<br/>
Usually the security updates are necessary though it is troublesome if the time would get back sometimes after the reboots.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<hr />

<p>When you google the way to set the time on EC2,<br/>
you’ll usually get the information like below.</p>

<p><code>cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Tokyo /etc/localtime</code></p>

<p>This is available when you want to set the time to your local time very soon.<br/>
But you need to be careful that this is not that the time is fixed.<br/>
To avoid the time setting gets initialized carelessly,<br/>
Not “/etc/localtime”, but “/etc/sysconfig/clock” is the file you need to edit.</p>

<p><code>
ZONE="Asia/Tokyo"
UTC=False
</code></p>
