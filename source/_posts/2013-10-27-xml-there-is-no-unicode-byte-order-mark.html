<div  class=post>
  Tried to open a xml file with XMLEDITOR.NET.  <br> <br>
  And the following error occured.  <br>
  <pre  class=prettyprint>
  There is no Unicode byte order mark. Cannot switch to Unicode.</pre>
  I checked the xml file, and fixed the line which said, <br>
  <pre  class=prettyprint>
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?&gt;</pre>
  to <br>
  <pre  class=prettyprint>
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</pre>
  wrong  : utf-16 <br>
  correct: utf-8 <br>
  <br>
  And now I could open it.<br>
</div>
